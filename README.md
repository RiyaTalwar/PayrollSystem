payroll system case study

Google pays salary to employee as per their work in shifts. Google has policy of two shifts, half
shift and full shift. 10:00AM to 3:00PM is considered as half shift and 10:00AM to 8:00PM
considered as full shift. Employees have to work for 5 days a week, and company remain close
during public holidays. Google has policy for employees as follows:
i. Employee must belong to one class and he/she has to obey the rules in policy for that
class.
ii. Number of leaves available to employees is based on their class.
iii. In case employee has available leaves then he/she can apply for leave application to
higher authority. If the leave is granted then he/she doesn't have to pay penalty for that
leave but he/she is not able to get salary o that day.
iv. If employee is absent without any reason or his/her leave was not accepeted by higher
authority then he has to pay penlaty for that day as per the class that employee belongs to.
Class 1 : salary 50000, penalty amount/day : 500
Class 2 : salary 60000, penalty amount/day : 600
Class 3 : salary 70000, penalty amount/day : 700


Task A
You have to print following detail for employee.
1. Payable salary at end of month.
2. Leave (which are granted) taken by an employee
3. Penalty amount
4. Net payable salary
5. Remaining leave status
6. Employee must be able to know about his/her remaining leave
7. If employee aply for leave system shows if his/her leave will be granted based upon his/her
leave balance. (If employee has 4 medical leaves and apply for 6 leave then system shows
rejection of leave application. And if he/she apply for 2 leave then 2 leave are accepted and 2
leaves remaining)
8. Employee should have to pay penalty amount if they had takem medical or casual leave more
then they had.
Consider the following calculation:
Employee Albert belongs to class 2.
Regular payable salary : 60000
payable salary/ day : 60000/30 = 2000
case 1: if he is absent for 5 days (although his leave was not granted for any days)
penalty amount =3000 (600*5)
he is present for 25 days so payable salary = 50000 (25 * 2000)
Net payable salary = 50000-3000 = 47000
case 2 : If he is absent for 5 days (his leave of 3 days was accepted)
penalty amount =1200 (600*2)
he is present for 25 days so payable salary = 50000 (25 * 2000)

Net payable salary = 50000-1200 = 48800

Employee


Task B

You had calculated net salary and penalty in Task A. Based on that information calculate
following.
1. Update leave status of employee to file. And consider it for new month and calculate all detail
given in Task A. (you have given employee attendance log file for new month)
2. At the end of first mont if penalty amount of employee is>=1000 then degrade class of
employee and if penalty amount <=500 then upgrade class of employee. (Employee from class 1
will not upgraded and if employee is in class 3 and penalty amount is >=1000 then he/she
should have to leave company) Update these all detail to employee information file (After
updating employee class their salary must be updated as per their respective class).
